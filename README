========================================
Batch commands to be started with Fabric
========================================

Required settings
-----------------

Note - `django_fabfile` package should be listed in your path. It's
already in place if your are installed it using `pip install
django-fabfile` from http://pypi.odeskps.com/. But if you are working
within repository, then::

    export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_folder_with_django_fabfile>

in your shell.

Pre-run configuration should be made for some modules - see details by
running::

    fab -f django_fabfile/<filename> -l

where <filename> is the module of interest.

Coding guidelines
-----------------

Imported functions should be prepended with underscore to hide them from
``fabric --list``.
