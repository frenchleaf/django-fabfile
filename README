Fabric tasks for Django and Amazon Web Services
===============================================

Required settings
-----------------

Note - `django_fabfile` package should be listed in your path. It's
already in place if your are installed it using `pip install
django-fabfile` from http://pypi.odeskps.com/. But if you are working
within repository, then::

    export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-folder-with-django_fabfile-package>

in your shell.

Pre-run configuration
---------------------

Django settings will be checked out if environment variable
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` configured properly. If not configured within
Django settings, then options will be taken from ./fabfile.cfg file -
copy-paste rows that should be overriden from
`django_fabfile/fabfile.cfg.def`."""
